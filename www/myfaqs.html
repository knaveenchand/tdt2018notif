Many of the roads, particularly are 4WD only dirt roads or broken bitumen. It will be slow going for all vehicles other then mountain bikes.</p><hr><p><b>Are there bike mechanics during TdT?<br> </b>Yes, there will be two bike mechanics from Australia. There will be a bike mechanics at the end of each stage with limited spare parts for sale at cost price. They do an amazing job, often working late into the night. Their names are Tim and Shane.</p><hr><p><b>Can I have my own support crew following me during the race?<br> </b>No, you cant BUT you can have friends and family join Tour de Timor as volunteers, assisting on water stations and in the campsite. The TdT campsite will only be accessible for registered riders, TdT volunteers and TdT Staff. For each stage, all riders will be supported with several water stations (staffed by both local and international volunteers) with medical staff available to assist.</p><hr><p><b>Who will change my tyre if I get a flat on the road?<br> </b>You will.</p><hr><p><b>Whats a SAG wagon?<br> </b>Its the first vehicle behind the last rider each day. SAG wagon team will assist at the start line each morning with check-in of riders as well as pick up any riders and their bikes along the way who are unable to finish the stage. Riders will receive a DNF (did not finish) for that day but are permitted to ride again the following day.</p><hr><p><b>Is there a daily sweep or cut-off time for riders?<br> </b>There will be a cut off location approx. 50% of the way through every day to ensure people are keeping a reasonable time to complete the stage. There will also be an end of day cut-off time at approx. 4pm for those final riders that have not finished the stage.</p><hr><p><b>Do I have to cook my own meals?<br> </b>No, you dont. Meals will be provided during the Tour from Tuesday lunch through til Saturday breakfast and costs are covered through your registration fee.</p><hr><p><b>What kind of medical support will there be?<br> </b>The event is proudly supported by NATIONAL CRITICAL CARE AND TRAUMA RESPONSE CENTRE (NCCTRC) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Government of Timor-Leste.</p><hr><p><b>Are there any hotels that I can stay in during the tour?<br> </b>No. The campsite location is outside of Aileu town.

We are travelling to some remote areas of the country so there will be limited opportunities to buy roadside food.</p><hr><p><b>What is appropriate clothing in the districts?<br> </b>You should be prepared for cool evenings (10 degrees) and always be ready for rain.

No helmet, no ride.</p><hr><p><b>Should I bring a camelback?<br> </b>It is recommended to have the capacity to carry more water than less. There will be several water stations per stage, how you choose to carry your water is your decision.</p><hr><p><b>Should I pace myself in stage 1?<br> </b>Stage 1 of the tour has something for everyone. Starting in the warmth of Dili, its important to pace your effort based upon your training history, how you are feeling on the day and your heat acclimatisation status. Those inexperienced in multi-day stage racing in warm/hot tropical conditions should race accordingly as overestimating your ability on the first stage could see you being picked up by the dreaded sag wagon, or worse, requiring treatment in the medical tent</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><b>Post Race</b></h3><p><b>What happens when we get back to Dili?<br> </b>Many riders stay at the finish line to cheer on other riders and celebrate. Later in the day will be a medal ceremony in Dili, which you will all be invited to attend, starting at 5pm.</p><hr><p><b>Do I need to wash my bike?<br> </b>If you are travelling back to your home country then your bike will need to be washed thoroughly and all dirt removed.

Merchandise will be available in Dili prior to the race, throughout the race in the campsites and after the race (if anything is still left) in Dili.</p><hr><p><b>How do I get to the airport with my bike?<br> </b>TdT will provide transport on Sunday 9th through to Monday 10th September from TdT HQ (Timor Lodge) to the Airport.
